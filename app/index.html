            <p>Whether you're after web design, iOS app development or graphic design, I'm friendly, easy-going and reliable. Surprised? I said obsessed, not deranged.</p>
            <p>With over 100 sites completed in the last 3 years, I've honed my results-focused approach into a kind of digital kung-fu that will leave your competitors reeling. And crucially, I know how to deliver results that suit your budget and business perfectly.</p>

                <h2>And web deisgn in Hereford!</h2>
                <p>I'm based in Hereford, but with the powers of modern communcations, we can work together! Having worked with lots of clients remotely already, I speak from experience when I say it really does work well, you pay me for sitting at my desk, working on your project, focusing on the details. <a href="#">More reasons...</a>
                </p>
                <p>A website is like a professional athlete. How's that? I hear you ask. Well, a good website can take time and money to develop, but its value is only as good as its performance. If it fails to draw attention and generate sales or enquiries, why bother?</p>
                <p>Fortunately, results is what I'm all about. And I have a track record that speaks for itself.</p>
                <h2>Interested in doubling your website's performance?</h2>
                <p>Typically, my clients can expect to see their website performance double when they start working with me. That's right. Double.</p>
                <p>When Kelly came to me looking to improve her website for Westdown Bathrooms, she was getting about 160 visits per month, and had a bounce rate of 60% (that's 6 out of 10 visitors clicking away after scanning the home page.) After I rebuilt it, she enjoyed an impressive 470 visits (average) per month, and a hugely reduced bounce rate of 35%.</p>
                <p>And that's just one of over 100 customer success stories I've been proud to be part of.</p>
                <h2>An obsession with efficiency, and delivery...</h2>
                <p>If you decide to join my growing legion of satisfied customers, you can expect to enjoy all these benefits:</p>
                <ul class="our-benefits">
                    <li>An efficient and smooth process, just ask any of my previous clients</li>

                <h2>Put your brand in their pockets with iOS app development</h2>
                <p>Time is running out for the humble desktop computer. The mobile revolution has arrived, and more than half of your audience will now be interacting with all things internet using their smartphones and tablets.</a>
                </p>
                <p>Does that mean you can do away with your website? No. A website is always going to be the fundamental way of making your business available to the casual prospect.</p>
                <p>Adding an iOS application to your arsenal just increases your chances of doing business with them.</p>
                <h2>A brilliant way to build rapport with your customers</h2>
                <p>You know the type. Can't even pass 10 minutes without checking something on their iPhone. And as digital services improve with each generation of handset, more of us are becoming dependent on our smartphones all the time.</p>
                <p>Having your own, native iOS application gives you a direct route to your customers' attention. One that takes advantage of the intuitive and satisfying iPhone design and experience.</p>

                <h2>Other benefits include:</h2>

                <ul class="our-benefits">
                    <li>Generating revenue by selling your app in the official app store</li>
                    <li>Generating revenue by selling your app in the official app store</li>

                </ul>
                <h2>A native speaker in the language of success</h2>
                <p>A native app is one that's developed especially for a particular system â€“ in this case iOS, the iPhone operating system.</p>
                <p>Having a native app gives you much more scope to interact with your users, and allows you to take advantage of millions of dollars worth of Apple's research and design. Native apps not only look and feel like the intuitive systems iPhone disciples rave about, but gives you access to the notification process. In other words, reminding your customers that you're there whenever you want to, straight to their handset.</p>
